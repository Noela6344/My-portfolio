Hello
I'm Noela Kipchumba ,a model, mentor, and passionate woman in tech. This is my personal portfolio, a space where I get to share who I am, what I do, and what Iâ€™m learning as I grow in this exciting field.

This project is built entirely with *HTML and CSS*, with no frameworks or libraries. It's part of a beginner web development challenge, and I poured my creativity and learning into it.



 About Me

Iâ€™m currently studying *software engineering, Python programming, database management, prompt engineering,* and *web development* at *PLP Academy*.  
I also hold a *Bachelor of Education Technology in Mechanical Technology* from *Moi University, Kenya*.

My goal is to build simple but impactful tech solutions, and to empower *young girls and women* to explore tech with confidence. I believe technology is a powerful tool for change â€” and Iâ€™m learning to use it every day.
